Chapter 6 Exercises
================

1. How does the recursive version of the factorial function behave if applies to a negative argument, such as `(-1)`? Modify the definition to prohibit negative arguments by adding a guard to the recursive case.

    The function terminates with an error if called with a negative argument. This is because it enters an "infinite loop" that causes a stack overflow. 

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    fac :: Int -> Int
    fac 0 = 1
    fac n | n > 0 = n * fac (n-1)
    ~~~

2. Define a recursive function `sumdown :: Int -> Int` that returns the sum of the non-negative integers from a given value down to zero. For exmaple, `sumdown 3` should return the result `3+2+1+0=6`.

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    sumdown :: Int -> Int
    sumdown 0 = 0
    sumdown n | n > 0 = n + sumdown (n-1)
    ~~~

3. Define the exponentiation operator `^` for non-negative integers using the same pattern of recursion as the multiplication operator `*`, and show how the expression `2 ^ 3` is evalutated using your definition. 

   ~~~ {.haskell}
   (^) :: Int -> Int -> Int
   m ^ 0 = 1
   m ^ n | n > 0 = m * (m Main.^ (n-1))
   ~~~

   ~~~
      2 ^ 3
    =   { applying ^ }
      2 * (2 ^ 2)
    =   { applying ^ }
      2 * (2 * (2 ^ 1))
    =   { applying ^ }
      2 * (2 * (2 * (2 ^ 0)))
    =   { applying ^ }
      2 * (2 * (2 * 1))
    =   { applying * }
      8
   ~~~

4. Define a recursive function `euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int` that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers: if the two numbers are equal, this number is the result; otherwise, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger, and the same process is then repeated. For example:

    ~~~
    > euclid 6 27
    3
    ~~~

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int
    euclid m n | m == n    = m
               | m > n     = euclid n (m-n)
               | otherwise = euclid m (n-m)
    ~~~

5. Using the recursive definitions given in this chapter, show how `length [1,2,3]`, `drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5]`, and `init [1,2,3]` are evaluated.

    ~~~ 
       length [1,2,3]
     =   { applying length }
       1 + length [2,3]
     =   { applying length }
       1 + (1 + length [3])
     =   { applying length }
       1 + (1 + (1 + length []))
     =   { applying length }
       1 + (1 + (1 + 0))
     =   { applying + }
       3
    ~~~

    ~~~
       drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
     =   { applying drop }
       drop 2 [2,3,4,5]
     =   { applying drop }
       drop 1 [3,4,5]
     =   { applying drop }
       drop 0 [4,5]
     =   { applying drop }
       [4,5]
    ~~~

    ~~~
      init [1,2,3] 
    =  { applying init }
      1 : init [2,3]
    =  { applying init }
      1 : (2 : init [3])
    =  { applying init }
      1 : (2 : [])
    =  { applying : }
      [1,2]
    ~~~

6. Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude, define the following library functions on lists using recursion.

    a. Decide if all logical values in a list are `True`: 

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    and :: [Bool] -> Bool
    and []     = True
    and (x:xs) = x && (Main.and xs)
    ~~~
    
    b. Concatenate a list of lists: 

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
    concat [] = []
    concat (x:xs) = x ++ (Main.concat xs)
    ~~~
    
    c. Produce a list with `n` identical elements: 

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
    replicate 0 _ = []
    replicate n x | n > 0 = x : (Main.replicate (n-1) x)
    ~~~
    
    d. Select the `n`<sup>th</sup> element of a list: 
    
    ~~~ {.haskell}
    (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
    (x:_) !! 0 = x
    (_:xs) !! n = xs Main.!! (n-1)
    ~~~
    
    e. Decide if a value is an element of a list: 
    
    ~~~ {.haskell}
    elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
    elem _ [] = False
    elem y (x:xs) | y == x = True
                  | otherwise = Main.elem y xs
    ~~~
    
    Note: most of these functions are defined in the prelude using other library functions rather than using explicit recursion,
